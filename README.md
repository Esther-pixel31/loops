## Logic Explanation

This Python project is a basic **Number Guessing Game** that helps practice control flow using `while` loops, `if-else` conditions, and comparison operators.

### 🔁 While Loop

The `while` loop is used to keep asking the user for a guess **until the correct number is guessed**:

while guess != secret_number:
    

### 🔄 Why Python Uses `elif` Instead of `else if` or `elsif`

Python uses `elif` (short for "else if") as a **clean, readable alternative** to the `else if` used in many other languages.

!=	Not equal to (used in while loop)	guess != secret_number
